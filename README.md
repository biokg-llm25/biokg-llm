## TL;DR

We introduce a two-fold contribution:

1️⃣ A **hackable, end-to-end pipeline** that constructs biomedical knowledge graphs from unstructured web data using a **web scraper, fuzzy matching, and large language models (LLMs)**.  
2️⃣ A **curated dataset** generated by applying this method to publicly available **drug leaflets** sourced from online pharmacies — capturing drug-centric attributes often missing in existing biomedical KGs.

## Overview

Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events, overlooking the rich, drug-centric data found in package leaflets.

In this work, we present: (1) An end-to-end pipeline for automatically constructing biomedical KGs from unstructured text using an LLM, and (2) A dataset in the form of a knowledge graph, created by applying the proposed method to publicly available drug package inserts sourced from online pharmacy websites.

The proposed method is modular, reproducible, and easy to adapt. Both the LLM and the input data can be substituted to generate different KGs. The resulting KG captures clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings, contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions, and physical characteristics, which are often missing in existing medical databases and KGs.

We evaluate the KG through manual inspection and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs and databases, highlighting complementary aspects such as storage instructions, dosage guidelines, and ingredient details that are often absent in these resources. We expect this dataset to support future applications in areas such as patient safety and drug recommendation, while the generation method can be easily adopted for other types of unstructured documents.

## Proposed Pipeline

We present an end-to-end pipeline for constructing a biomedical knowledge graph from unstructured drug leaflet data. The process begins with data collection, where drug leaflets are scraped from online pharmacies using a web scraper built using Python and converted into machine-readable text. This raw data is then processed using a prompt-based approach with an LLM for information extraction, focusing on key drug-related entities and their interrelationships. The extracted entities undergo further refinement through NER and relation mapping, ultimately being transformed into nodes and labeled edges. These are subsequently post-processed and organized into a CSV format, which serves as the foundation of the knowledge graph. The figure below provides a visual overview of the entire pipeline, illustrating each processing stage from data collection to knowledge graph construction.

## Features

- *End-to-End Biomedical KG Pipeline:*  A modular and hackable pipeline that extracts structured knowledge from unstructured text using web scraping, LLMs, NER, and relation mapping. Both the LLM and scraper components can be easily replaced or customized.

- *Drug Leaflet-Centric Knowledge Graph:*  Constructed from 13,000+ drug leaflets sourced from the HPRA, capturing real-world, patient-facing clinical data often overlooked in existing biomedical resources.

- *LLM-Based Information Extraction:*  Utilizes LLaMA 3 70B Instruct for prompt-based extraction of subject–predicate–object triples directly from full-text PDFs, avoiding the need for chunking and preserving context.

- *Ready-to-Use Dataset:*  The resulting knowledge graph can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/biokg-llm25/biokg-llm/blob/main/data/biomedical_kg.csv) in a ready-to-use CSV format.

- *Broader Clinical Coverage:*  Captures practical features often missing in other biomedical KGs and databases, including storage information, physical appearance (shape, color), and inactive ingredients.

- *Generalizable & Open Source:*  The pipeline is reusable and adaptable across domains and document types, and the full codebase is open source.
